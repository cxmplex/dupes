# dupes

Very simple CLI tool to count duplicates. Great for checking proxy/combo lists.

## to run

```
python main.py file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

Best use is to bind python main.py to an alias, i.e. dupe file1 file2

## output

```
Total entries: 199996 | Total Duplicates: 0 | Percent Duplicated: 0
```
